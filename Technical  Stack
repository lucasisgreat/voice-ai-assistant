• CORE AI ENGINE
BUILT ON LLAMA.CPP, A LIGHTWEIGHT VERSION OF A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL THAT CAN RUN FULLY OFFLINE POWERS THE ASSISTANT’S UNDERSTANDING AND TEXT
GENERATION, STREAMING TOKENS AS THEY’RE GENERATED SO RESPONSES START QUICKLY. THE MODEL IN USE IS OPENHERMES 2.5 MISTRAL 7B, OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED AND
CONVERSATIONAL TONE. 
• SPEECH SYSTEM
USES COQUI XTTS V2, A MULTILINGUAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYSTEM TO GENERATE THE VOICE FROM A SELECT NUMBER OF REFERENCE CLIPS. THE USER PROVIDED
REVERENCE AUDIO IS AUTOMATICALLY SEGMENTED AND ADJUSTED TO 24 KHZ MONO USING FFMPEG, AND BOUNDED BY A MAX CLIP COUNT FOR STABILITY. OUTPUT AUDIO
IS THEN PEAK-LIMITED TO −1 DBFS FOR CLEAR, CONSISTENT LOUDNESS.
• STREAMING & LATENCY CONTROL
TOKEN DELTAS ARE BUFFERED INTO SHORT PHRASE-SIZED CHUNKS (PUNCTUATION/LENGTH HEURISTICS). EACH CHUNK IS SENT IMMEDIATELY TO TTS, SO SPEECH BEGINS
WHILE THE MODEL IS STILL GENERATING REST OF THE RESPONSE.
• AUDIO PIPELINE
THE SYSTEM READS YOUR TYPED INPUT, SENDS IT THROUGH THE AI MODEL, THEN BEGINS SPEAKING THE RESPONSE AS SOON AS THE FIRST PHRASE IS READY. AUDIO IS
GENERATED AND PLAYED IN REAL TIME, USING FALLBACK METHODS (PAPLAY → APLAY → FFPLAY) SO IF ONE TOOL ISN’T AVAILABLE, THE NEXT ONE TAKES OVER AND YOU STILL
HEAR AUDIO. TEMPORARY AUDIO FILES EXIST ONLY FOR THE SESSION AND ARE REMOVED ON SHUTDOWN.
• PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE
-MAIN PROCESS (ORCHESTRATOR): BUILDS MESSAGES, MANAGES STREAMING/PHRASE BUFFERING, TRIMS IN-RAM HISTORY, HANDLES CLEANUP.
-SUBPROCESS (TTS WORKER): LOADS XTTS AND SYNTHESIZES SPEECH. A SIMPLE READINESS HANDSHAKE ([TTS] READY) AND A BOUNDED WAIT PREVENT DEADLOCKS
BEFORE STREAMING BEGINS.
THIS TWO-PROCESS SETUP KEEPS TEXT GENERATION AND SPEECH RUNNING SIDE-BY-SIDE FOR LOWER LATENCY.
• HARDWARE USAGE
AUTOMATICALLY PICKS THE BEST AVAILABLE GPU (LARGEST VRAM) FOR THE LLM. THE TTS WORKER PREFERS A SECOND GPU WHEN PRESENT; OTHERWISE IT SHARES OR
RUNS ON THE CPU.
• MEMORY & PRIVACY
CONVERSATION HISTORY LIVES ONLY IN RAM DURING THE SESSION AND IS WIPED ON EXIT. TEMPORARY WAVS ARE STORED IN A SESSION TEMP FOLDER AND DELETED ON
SHUTDOWN; NO LONG-TERM LOGS.
• CONFIGURATION & CONTROLS
MODELS AND VOICES ARE DISCOVERED FROM USER-DEFINED DIRECTORIES WHILE SIMPLE CONSOLE COMMANDS LET YOU LIST/SWITCH MODELS AND ADJUST CHARACTER
STYLE WITHOUT EDITING ANY CODE. ADVANCED OVERRIDES ARE AVAILABLE VIA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IF YOU NEED TO PIN SPECIFIC DEVICES (E.G.,
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, GPU_LLM_FORCE_INDEX, GPU_TTS_FORCE_INDEX, N_GPU_LAYERS)
